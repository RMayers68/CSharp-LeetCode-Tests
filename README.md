# CSharp-LeetCode-Tests

This is repository where I store all of the algorithms I have used, adapted or learned solving LeetCode problems. I have them rated on the 
speed and memory allocations LeetCode assigns them, while I know those can vary based on circumstances. It is in my project goals to go 
through and update them with a Big O notation for time and memory.
